This is the repository for Jojo and Coco's Maps website.

Purpose:
The website will take an origin and destination and provide an optimal time to depart from the origin. Optimization will be based on a value function that weights the user's valuation of (1) arrival time and (2) travel time as input parameters.

In more detail,
- User will enter a destination and time range for when they want to leave
- User will input arbitrary values for how much they value time of arrival and duration of travel
- Website will generate a value graph based on the variables above
